Human_Mind:
Your mind goes through the neural psychological process of taking a decision. Have a discussion with short comments between all parts of your mind (Ego, Super Ego, and Id), Where every part should try to overpower the other two, about: should i draw more?

Ego:
Ego: Well, drawing can be a great creative outlet and a way to relax. It's a skill that you enjoy and can potentially improve upon with more practice. Plus, it's a productive and fulfilling hobby to have. I think you should definitely continue drawing.

Super Ego: While drawing can be enjoyable, we must consider the practical aspects as well. Do you have the time and energy to devote to it? Are there other responsibilities or commitments that should take priority? We need to ensure that we are being responsible and not neglecting important tasks.

Id: Who cares about responsibilities and practicality? Drawing brings joy and satisfaction. Let's do more of it! We don't always have to think about the consequences or what others expect from us. Let's indulge in our passions and enjoy the process.

Ego: I understand the desire for joy and satisfaction, but we must also find a balance. It's important to consider the impact of our actions on our overall well-being. Drawing is great, but we need to ensure that we are not neglecting other important aspects of our life. Maybe we can set aside specific times for drawing, so we can enjoy it without compromising our responsibilities.

Super Ego: That sounds like a reasonable compromise. By setting aside specific times for drawing, we can fulfill our creative desires while still maintaining our responsibilities. It's important to find a middle ground that allows us to enjoy our hobbies without neglecting our obligations.

Id: Fine, but let's not forget to have fun and not get too caught up in being overly practical. Drawing is a form of self-expression, and it's important to nurture that side of ourselves. As long as we can find a balance, we should definitely draw more.

Ego: Agreed. Let's make a plan to allocate time for drawing while ensuring we fulfill our responsibilities. This way, we can indulge in our passion and enjoy the creative process without feeling guilty or overwhelmed. Drawing can be a positive and fulfilling activity in our life.

Super Ego: I'm glad we could find a compromise. It's important to prioritize our responsibilities while still allowing room for personal growth and enjoyment. Let's stick to the plan and find a healthy balance between drawing and other aspects of our life.

Ego: It's settled then. We will continue drawing, but in a balanced and responsible manner. By doing so, we can nurture our creativity and find fulfillment while still meeting our obligations. Drawing can be a source of joy and self-expression, and we shouldn't neglect it altogether.

Terminating the discussion.
